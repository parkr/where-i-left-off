I have recently become somewhat fixated on the story of Aaron Swartz. I
idolize his ability to dismiss the money and fame, and focus more on the
action. He always seemed to ask himself how he could best spend his time.
Somehow, his answer was perpetually of great help to those around him. I
wish I had had the chance to know him in person. I suppose the best I can
do is immerse myself in the content he created and shared for all of us and
in the memories those who knew him have shared.

The *New Republic* article discusses Aaron's interest in George Saunders'
writings. I found the following articles on the topic:
