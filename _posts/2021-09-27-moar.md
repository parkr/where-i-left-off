### poems

> Finish each day and be done with it. <br>
> You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. <br>
> Tomorrow is a new day. <br>
> You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense. <br>
>
> â€“ [Ralph Waldo Emerson, the sticker](https://society6.com/product/ralph-waldo-emerson-finish-each-day-inspirational-quote_sticker?sku=s6-11610519p65a211v751a212v753)

> When I die                          <br>
> Give whatâ€™s left of me away         <br>
> To children                         <br>
> And old men that wait to die.       <br>
>                                     <br>
> And if you need to cry,             <br>
> Cry for your brother                <br>
> Walking the street beside you.      <br>
> And when you need me,               <br>
> Put your arms                       <br>
> Around anyone                       <br>
> And give them                       <br>
> What you need to give to me.        <br>
>                                     <br>
> I want to leave you something,      <br>
> Something better                    <br>
> Than words                          <br>
> Or sounds.                          <br>
>                                     <br>
> Look for me                         <br>
> In the people Iâ€™ve known            <br>
> Or loved,                           <br>
> And if you cannot give me away,     <br>
> At least let me live on in your eyes<br>
> And not your mind.                  <br>
>                                     <br>
> You can love me most                <br>
> By letting                          <br>
> Hands touch hands,                  <br>
> By letting bodies touch bodies,     <br>
> And by letting go                   <br>
> Of children                         <br>
> That need to be free.               <br>
>                                     <br>
> Love doesnâ€™t die,                   <br>
> People do.                          <br>
> So, when all thatâ€™s left of me      <br>
> Is love,                            <br>
> Give me away.                       <br>
>
